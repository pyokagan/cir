CIR is a *C source-to-source compiler* that comes with a JIT.
This JIT enables arbitrary functions to be evaluated at compile time.
Additionally, compile-time-evaluated functions can manipulate code as data and call-back into the compiler API,
enabling _compile-time metaprogramming_ to be performed.

This project is being developed as an undergraduate final year project at the National University of Singapore.

[WARNING]
====
This project is still in its infancy and under *heavy development*.
Don't expect to be able to use this in real C projects yet.
====

== Getting started

Currently the JIT only compiles for *x86-64* systems that use the *System V ABI*.
This means it currently only works on Linux (and theoretically Mac OS as well).

Only GCC/Clang (a version that supports the C11 standard) is required to compile CIR.
MSVC is not supported as the source code currently uses some GCC extensions.

== A tour of CIR

=== Compiling programs down to CIR

Here is a program which prints the 20th number in the Fibonacci sequence:

.`fib.c`
[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

static int fib(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        int c = b;
        b = a + b;
        a = c;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return a;
}

int main(void) {
    printf("The answer is: %d\n", fib(20));
    return 0;
}
----

To use it with CIR, we first need to pass it through the C preprocessor to process `#includes`:

----
gcc -E -o fib.cpp.c fib.c
----

[TIP]
====
CIR requires source files to first be run through the C preprocessor.
For the rest of this document we will assume that this is done.
====

We can then pass the preprocessed file (`fib.cpp.c`) into CIR:

----
./cir fib.cpp.c >fib.output.c
----

The output from CIR is:

.`fib.output.c`
[source,c]
----
static int vid57_fib(int vid58_n)
{
    int vid59_a;
    int vid60_b;
    int vid61_i;
    int vid62_c;
    int vid63;
    int vid64;

    vid59_a = 0; /* sid1 */
    vid60_b = 1; /* sid2 */
    vid61_i = 0; /* sid3 */
sid4:
    if (vid61_i < vid58_n) goto sid6; /* sid4 */
    goto sid13; /* sid5 */
sid6:
    vid62_c = vid60_b; /* sid6 */
    vid63 = vid59_a + vid60_b; /* sid7 */
    vid60_b = vid63; /* sid8 */
    vid59_a = vid62_c; /* sid9 */
    vid64 = vid61_i + 1; /* sid10 */
    vid61_i = vid64; /* sid11 */
    goto sid4; /* sid12 */
sid13:
    /* nop */; /* sid13 */
    return vid59_a; /* sid14 */
}
extern int printf(char *__restrict __format, ...);
int main(void)
{
    int vid66;
    int vid67;

    vid66 = vid57_fib(20); /* sid15 */
    vid67 = printf("The answer is: %d\n", vid66); /* sid16 */
    return 0; /* sid17 */
}
----

As we can see, CIR has compiled `fib.cpp.c` into a three-address-code-like representation that is a subset of the C programming language.
This representation is called "CIR", meaning "C Immediate Language".

While it may seem at first that the CIR representation is horribly inefficient,
modern optimizing compilers such as GCC will actually compile both `fib.c` and `fib.output.c` to the https://godbolt.org/z/N4AtaD[same assembly code]:

[source,asm]
----
.LC0:
        .string "The answer is: %d\n"
main:
        sub     rsp, 8
        mov     eax, 20
        mov     esi, 1
        mov     edx, 0
        jmp     .L2
.L3:
        mov     esi, ecx
.L2:
        lea     ecx, [rdx+rsi]
        mov     edx, esi
        sub     eax, 1
        jne     .L3
        mov     edi, OFFSET FLAT:.LC0
        mov     eax, 0
        call    printf
        mov     eax, 0
        add     rsp, 8
        ret
----

However, as can be seen from the assembly listing,
we are actually still computing the value of `fib(20)` at _runtime_.
Can we do better?

=== The `@` compile-time evaluation operator

CIR extends the C programming language with the compile-time evaluation operator, `@`.
Function calls that are prefixed with `@` will be evaluated at compile-time.

Here is the modified `fib.c` source file with the `@` operator added:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>

static int fib(int n) {
    int a = 0, b = 1, i = 0;
    while (i < n) {
        int c = b;
        b = a + b;
        a = c;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return a;
}

int main(void) {
    printf("The answer is: %d\n", @fib(20)); // @ operator added
    return 0;
}
----

CIR now outputs:

[source,c]
----
extern int printf(char *__restrict __format, ...);
int main(void)
{
    int vid66;

    vid66 = printf("The answer is: %d\n", 6765); /* sid15 */
    return 0; /* sid16 */
}
----

As we can see, the call to `fib(20)` has been replaced with the constant `6765`,
which is indeed the 20th number in the fibonacci sequence.

So what happened?
CIR JIT-compiled the `fib()` function into X86-64 machine code, executed it, and then inlined the result (`6765`) into the callsite.

=== _Arbitrary_ compile-time evaluation

The JIT is a full-featured C compiler footnote:[The JIT compiler is still in its infancy, so full C language support has not been implemented yet. However, it is an explicit goal of the project.].
This means that you can *use any C language construct you want*, such as conditionals, loops, calling other functions etc.

Furthermore, JIT-compiled code can *call external functions and libraries*.
This includes C standard library APIs such as `malloc()`, `free()`, `fopen()`, `fwrite()`, `printf()` etc.

For example, here is a compile-time function that reads a file using C standard library APIs and returns it as a string constant:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "../cir.h" // include compiler API

// Reads a file and returns it as a string constant
static CirCodeId readFile(char *path) {
    FILE *fp = fopen(path, "r");
    if (!fp)
        cir_fatal("failed to open %s", path);
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_END);
    size_t len = ftell(fp);
    fseek(fp, 0, SEEK_SET);
    char *buffer = malloc(len + 1);
    fread(buffer, len, 1, fp);
    buffer[len] = 0;
    fclose(fp);
    return CirCode_ofExpr(CirValue_ofString(buffer, len + 1));
}

int main(void) {
    puts(@readFile("fileToBeRead.txt"));
    return 0;
}
----

However, this also means that the compile-time evaluation may not halt,
or may even crash.
_With great power comes great responsibility_,
developers need to exercise care when writing compile-time functions.

=== Compile-time metaprogramming

Code evaluated at compile-time can *call back into the compiler API*.

CIR will examine the *type* of compile-time-evaluated functions:

* When a compile-time function declares its argument(s) to take a _code object_ (`CirCodeId`),
CIR will pass the raw code (in IR form) into the function.

* When a compile-time function declares its return type to be a _code object_ (`CirCodeId`),
CIR will inline the returned code object as-is into the call site.

For example, here is a function that receives `CirCodeId` as an argument,
and examines the IR contained within:

[source,c]
----
#include <stdbool.h>
#include "../cir.h" // include compiler API

// Returns true if code calls a function, otherwise returns false
static bool callsAFunction(CirCodeId code) {
    CirStmtId stmt = CirCode_getFirstStmt(code);
    while (stmt) {
        if (CirStmt_isCall(stmt))
            return true;
        stmt = CirStmt_getNext(stmt);
    }
    return false;
}
----

And can be used as follows:

[source, c]
----
@callsAFunction(puts("Hi")); // evaluates to 1
@callsAFunction(42); // evaluates to 0
----

[NOTE]
====
Notice how a simple `while` loop is sufficient in discovering whether there is a call in an expression.
CIR is explicitly designed to be _flat_ so as to make such traversals and manipulation of the IR easy,
without needing to resort to recursive function calls or the visitor pattern which are more of a hassle to write in C.
====

Here is another function that returns a code object containing a string constant.

[source,c]
----
#include <stdio.h>
#include "cir.h" // include compiler API

static CirCodeId generateCode() {
    return CirCode_ofExpr(CirValue_ofCString("Inlined String"));
}

int main(void) {
    puts(@generateCode());
    return 0;
}
----

And the result is:

[source,c]
----
extern int puts(char *__s);
int main(void)
{
    int vid260;

    vid260 = puts("Inlined String"); /* sid4 */
    return 0; /* sid5 */
}
----

== Acknowledgements

This project was initially prototyped with https://github.com/cil-project/cil[CIL] before being ported to C.
Certain parts of CIL still remain,
such as the representation of types, structs, typedefs, attributes etc.
